hello spectator

value your life and spend your time wisely as it is finite.
fear no grave, never give in to gluttony and remember that death shall come before dishonor.
combined with ethical and moral values, this is your recipe to become immortal.
why?, becuse life is temporary and legacy is (can be) eternal.
thrive to be unforgettable and for you it is that fortune will work in your favor.
